There will be a mix of both theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical parts will be more prominent in the first half of this module, while practical exercises will take most of the time in the second half.\n","\n","During the theory-focused sprints, you will get an in-depth understanding of how the Tezos Blockchain works. It serves multiple purposes – first of all, a general understanding is crucial for effectively creating many smart contracts. Imagine writing a smart contract having no idea how long it will take to execute it! Secondly, the unique-self amending process of Tezos is very important as it will lead to many drastic changes in how the blockchain works. You need to be aware about how such changes are introduced to be able to keep your code up-to-date. Even better yet, once you get experienced enough, you can even get involved in preparing these changes! Finally, having a genuine interest in the core concepts behind Tezos will not only make it more motivating to work in its ecosystem, but is also something that many employers are looking for.\n","\n","The practical parts will teach you everything you need to know in order to start understanding and writing complex smart contracts (although you should also keep in mind that the more simple the smart contract, the better!). While there are a couple of popular languages that you can work with (SmartPy, LIGO, Archetype), the biggest focus will be on one of them – LIGO. This is because it has a couple of different possible syntaxes that you can choose from, making it easier for developers from different backgrounds to start working with it. By learning to write contracts with LIGO, you will be able to learn most of the core concepts of Tezos smart contracts that will be used in other languages as well. \n","\n","Furthermore, the practical parts will give you an initial understanding of Michelson - the low level language that Tezos smart contracts actually run. While not used as commonly by regular Tezos developers anymore, it’s still very useful to have a general understanding which would allow you to do some basic debugging in case your smart contracts mysteriously don’t work the way you want them to. Lastly, you will practice working with Taquito, an extremely popular tool for creating DApps with Tezos – the main goal of module 3. \n","\n","An important note: Tezos, like most blockchain technologies, is rapidly developing and documentation lacks behind sometimes. This course aims to be as resilient as possible by giving goals and possible resources that help you to achieve those goals, but never insisting that those resources are the only ones you should use. You should expect that sometimes a resource will be out of date and that you might need to search for ways to get around it. We try to have guidance and tips for finding the most recent pieces of information, but even those might get out of date quickly. In these cases, we would be extremely grateful if you could report this to us using the support chat function inside the Turing College platform. Not only will that help others learning this course, but it is a great way for you to demonstrate that you are a good candidate for becoming a Junior Team Lead. In some cases when even the most official documentation is out of date, we might give specific exercises meant to challenge you to get around that and find the up-to-date solution yourself.\n","\n","\n","**Sprint Goals**\n","\n","- Understand the basics of how Tezos differs from other blockchains\n","- Understand how smart contracts work on the Tezos blockchain\n","- Learn about Tezos communities and how to reach them\n","- Learn to use Block Explorers to conveniently check the state of the Tezos blockchain\n","- Learn to interact with the Tezos blockchain using CLI\n","- Learn how to test your work with testnets in Tezos\n","- Learn about how governance works in Tezos\n","- Start writing and deploying your first smart contracts in Tezos using the LIGO language\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YJl8sEbIPS8D"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1 – What is Tezos?\n","\n","In the first part of this sprint, you will start by going through several resources broadly introducing you to the core concepts behind Tezos. You will learn about Liquid Proof of Stake, governance and the self-amendment process in Tezos, how smart contracts work on Tezos, how to hold Tez in wallets and what community resources you might want to follow. \n","\n","One of the resources will be a great introductory presentation by an early architect of Tezos – Arthur Breitman. Later on, however, when learning about the governance of Tezos in more depth, you will see that Tezos is currently developed by many different groups of people and that there’s no longer a single or even a couple of people who are responsible for it. A common theme you will notice between various people and organizations working with Tezos (and hopefully find inspiring) is that among the proponents of Tezos everyone is very much focused on finding and implementing real use-cases using this blockchain.\n","\n","\t\n","## Key Resources\n","- Overview of Tezos and why it was created (*20 minutes*)\n","  - [Tezos basics](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/ )\n","  - [What is Tezos?](https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/)\n","- [An interview with Tezos early architect Arthur Breitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpLHwzEtKEQ)  (*50 minutes*)\n","<BR> Note: do not worry and spend too much time in order to fully understand roll ups that are talked about in the middle section of this video. You will be able to investigate them further later on.\n","- [A more technical intro to Tezos and smart contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNpzmAO2vLs) (*20 minutes*) \n","<BR> Note: it’s not crucial for Tezos development to fully understand how Bitcoin script works, so don’t spend too much extra time on that section if you’re not particularly curious about it\n","- [Wallets in Tezos](https://tezos.com/learn/store-and-use/) (*20 minutes*) \n","<BR> Compare the wallets and install at least 2 of them to try out. Make sure that at least one of them allows changing which network it connects to, i.e. either the main network (mainnet) or a test network (testnet). This will make free testing easier later on. Umami, Temple are examples of wallets that allow you to do this.\n","<BR> We don’t recommend transferring any money into the wallets just yet if you don’t want to. The mentioned test networks will be a great way to experiment with Tez and see how it works.\n","- Tezos community and main organizations (*20 minutes*) \n","<BR> Check some of the various Tezos communities and organizations listed below. Whenever you get questions about Tezos that you can’t easily find answers to yourself, it’s a good idea to consider asking the community, e.g. Discord, Telegram or Slack channels. For now, just get a sense of what different communities there are – don't spend too much time exploring each one of them unless you are particularly interested.\n","  - [Tezos communities list](https://tezos.com/community/)\n","  - [Tezos ecosystem](https://tezos.com/ecosystem) \n","  - [Tezos stackexchange](https://tezos.stackexchange.com/) \n","  - [Tezos Telegram](https://t.me/tezosplatform)\n","  - [Tezos developers Telegram](https://t.me/TezosDevelopers) \n","  - [ECADLabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecadlabs)\n","  - [Tezos Commons](https://twitter.com/TezosCommons)\n","  - [BakingBad](https://twitter.com/tezosbakingbad)\n","  - [Nomadic Labs](https://twitter.com/LabosNomades)"],"metadata":{"id":"HOS62Ud2PUoY"}}]}
