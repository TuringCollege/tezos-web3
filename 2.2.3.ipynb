In this part, we will look into what kind of use cases are being explored and implemented already. Most of it will focus on the Tezos blockchain, but we will end with a resource which is not specific to a particular blockchain, instead simply listing many possible use cases that you can explore. Many of the resources in this part will be links to specific projects. In module 1 of this course, you have learned how to critically and deeply evaluate various projects – it’s time to practice these skills once again!\n","\n","\n","## Key resources\n","- [Use cases of Tezos](https://wiki.tezos.com/learn/uses-of-tezos/ ) *(30 minutes)*:\n","  <BR>Skim over this, note use cases that seem interesting to you. Explore 1-3 use cases more deeply by checking the projects. The goal is to get a sense of what is worked on and to know that you can refer back to this later on if you get interested in a specific area\n","- [Energy consumption of Tezos]() *(10 minutes)*\n","https://wiki.tezos.com/learn/baking/tezos-energy-consumption \n","Direction for further research: what kinds of use cases become possible when the energy consumption is so much lower than in PoW blockchains?\n","- [Tezos Domains](https://tezos.domains/)\n"," *(15 minutes)*\n","  - Optional: [Tez Talks Live on Tezos Domains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcAJKV_05E8)\n","- [Tezotopia](https://tezotopia.com/home/ ). It has by far the most active “sub-community” on Tezos, the Telegram group is very active. *(15 minutes)*\n","\n","- [OBJKT](https://objkt.com/). It’s a marketplace that allows trading of NFTs, such as the Tezotopia NFTs.

Use your experience in web3 so far to evaluate whether they are trustworthy and have potential. Also, try to evaluate whether being launched on the Tezos blockchain gives them any particular advantages. \n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NMsQy2YqJqES"}}]}
