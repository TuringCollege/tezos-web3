By the end of this part, you will have a good basic understanding of this language. In case you need to use it more extensively, you should be able to use this knowledge as a strong  basis for further, deeper learning. If not, it is still going to be interesting to see how the high-level languages actually follow the ideas and structure of Michelson quite  strongly. \n","\n","## Part Tasks\n","[Michelson continued](https://michelson.baking-bad.org/chapters/08.html) up to chapter 15 (inclusive) *(180 minutes)*\n","- [Michelson examples](https://opentezos.com/michelson/examples)\n","<BR>Choose two out of the 5 given and go through them trying to understand fully how they work\n","- [Michelson anti-patterns](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/michelson_anti_patterns.html) *(30 minutes)*\n","\n","## Direction for further research\n","- Try to find an actual deployed smart contract and understand how at least a part of it (maybe one entry point) works. You can search for popular dapps (which have underlying smart contracts) here: https://tzkt.io/dapps \n","- Write a smart contract in any of your preferred high-level language (LIGO/Archetype/Smartpy), transpile it to Michelson. Check whether you fully understand the generated code. Do you think it is possible to write the program in a more optimized Michelson code than what was generated?"],"metadata":{"id":"NMsQy2YqJqES"}}]}
