The smart contract should store a map of usernames (as strings) and integers associated with those usernames. The integers need to be calculated in a specific way, however. Here are the specifications:\n","\n","\n","## Project Specifications\n","- The smart contract should be invoked with a string and an integer.\n","- After a successful invocation, the map in the contract’s storage should be updated so that the received string maps to an integer value which is the product of the received integer and the integer that the last user has invoked the smart contract with.\n","- If it’s the first time the contract is being invoked, simply store the integer sent (no multiplication is required).\n","- If a 0 is sent as the input integer, perform all computations as if 1 was sent.\n","- If the received string has already been seen before, do nothing (i.e. the contract should act as if this invocation was never made).\n","\n","For example, if it’s the first time someone executes the contract and sends [“John”, 5], the storage should become [“John”, 5]. If the second time parameters [“Bob”, 3] are sent, the storage should become [[“John”, 5], [“Bob”, 15]]. If the third invocation is [“Charlie, 2”], the resulting map in the storage should be [[“John”, 5], [“Bob”, 15], [“Charlie”, 6]]. If [“Bob”, 10] is sent, the storage should still remain  [[“John”, 5], [“Bob”, 15], [“Charlie”, 6]].\n","\n","Besides the <string, int> map, the storage of the contract is free for you to decide.\n","\n","## Project Presentation\n","\n","During the correction, you should first explain how your smart contract works by showing the code. Then, you should demonstrate how the smart contract works by deploying it to a testnet and making several invocations, then using an indexer to show the results. \n","\n","For the second part of the project, you should send 50 Tez on a testnet to the reviewer. You should confirm the updated balance via CLI and show the transaction on an explorer. \n","\n","Finally, as the third part of this project, you should choose 2 topics of further research from this sprint and prepare a 5 minute presentation on each of those topics (10 minutes in total). You are free to choose anything connected to the first sprint – it can be an exploration of Tezos governance, some interesting ways to use the tezos-client CLI, something interesting about smart contracts that wasn’t part of the Ligo Academy or anything else you find interesting. Start the each of the two presentations by framing your topic as a question and asking if the reviewer already knows the answer – this will spark their curiosity and allow them to test their own knowledge as well - let them try to answer the question or make a guess, then provide your own explanation in the presentation. \n","\n","\n","## Submission and Scheduling a Correction\n","Before submitting your project, double-check that you have saved your project in your Turing College GitHub repository. Then, click the \"Submit Project\" button in the Turing College platform. You will see the times when reviewers are available. Book a time that suits you. If there are no times available, message us in the #community_help channel on Discord. We will make sure that a reviewer adds a time slot for you.\n","\n","You should also add times for reviewing projects from your peers. You can do so by clicking on \"My Availability\". Note that receiving a review costs 1 correction point. Once you run out of correction points, you will not be able to progress further until you review the project of at least one other learner. Performing a review awards you 2 correction points. We strongly suggest adding availability slots regularly as it might take some time until somebody books a review with you. Once somebody books a correction with you, you will be notified via email. Make sure you do not miss it and review the uploaded work beforehand!\n","\n","\n","## Sample Questions\n","Here are questions that the reviewer may choose to ask during the correction.\n","\n","- Where is a smart contract stored?\n","- Who pays for the deployment and execution of a smart contract?\n","- What determines the price of a smart contract?\n","- What possible issues are there in the current LPOS model of Tezos?\n","- What possible issues are there in the current governance model of Tezos?\n","- What further new use cases do you think blockchain technology could solve?\n","- What web3 projects do you think try to solve a problem that web2 already solves sufficiently?\n","- How do you check the public and private keys of accounts that you use in tezos-client?\n","\n","A reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more questions.\n","\n","Note: The goal of the corrections is to promote a deeper understanding of learned topics by both learners. The reviewer and the reviewed learner must strive for a cooperative, friendly, and helpful interaction. Remember that both parties will rate each other after the correction on their technical and soft skills.\n","\n","\n","## Project Evaluation Criteria\n","- Code for smart contract written and working according to specifications\n","- Learner has the necessary basic understanding of smart contracts and LIGO\n","- Learner is able to deploy, invoke and inspect the smart contract\n","- The topics chosen for 2 presentations were interesting and went beyond the basics covered in the course.\n","- The quality of soft skills during presenting, e.g. was the learner engaging, professional & clear?\n","- General understanding of the theoretical topics covered in sprint 1.\n","- Learner is able to use tezos-client to make a transaction and demonstrates a good basic understanding of how it works.\n","- General understanding of the theoretical topics covered in this sprint.\n","\n","\n","Note: Your work will be evaluated based not only on the information in your presentation but also on your presentation skills and how convincing you are. Such soft skills are incredibly important for any career and will be extremely valuable to practice and receive feedback."],"metadata":{"id":"_hDnsWfaVFvf"}}]}
