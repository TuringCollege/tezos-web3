While it’s not worth going extremely in-depth into each one of them right now, when you’re just beginning to get into working with Tezos, it’s still useful to get an idea of these features. This will allow you to better understand what potential things you can create with Tezos and what topics to go much deeper into for specific implementations. \n","  The part will also end with a suggestion for further research that we strongly recommend trying out – finding documentation projects that you can make suggestions to. This can of course be a great way to start becoming more well-known in the community and at the same time a way to make yourself pay closer attention to the resources that you read.\n","\n","\n","## Part Resources\n","- [FA1.2 and FA2 Tokens](https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/756-blockchain-tezos-token-standards) *(100 minutes)*\n","  <BR> For now, no need to go through full implementation guides for LIGO and smartPY given in the table). It’s enough to only read through the main article\n","Try to deploy the marketplace contract given in the example.\n","- (optional) [More in-depth look at FA2 tokens](https://tezos.b9lab.com/fa2)\n"," \n","- [Oracles Open Tezos](https://opentezos.com/defi/oracles/) *(15 minutes)*\n","- [Oracles B9Lab](https://tezos.b9lab.com/oracles) *(40 minutes)*\n"," \n","- [Tickets explanation and examples](https://tezos.org.ua/en/blog/tezos-tickets-explanation-and-examples) *(15 minutes)*\n","- [Tickets Marigold guide](https://www.marigold.dev/post/tickets-for-dummies) *(30 minutes)*\n","<BR> Optional: try to implement a simple smart contract that uses tickets. These resources will be useful:\n","  - https://medium.com/tqtezos/tickets-on-tezos-part-1-a7cad8cc71cd \n","  - https://opentezos.com/smart-contracts/smart-contracts-concepts#tickets \n","- [Sapling](https://opentezos.com/smart-contracts/smart-contracts-concepts#sapling ) *(10 minutes)*\n","- (optional) [More detailed look into sapling](https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/sapling.html)\n","<BR> It’s not mandatory to get into the details of how sapling is implemented at this point. The important thing is to understand what it is and that if needed, Tezos is capable of providing this functionality.\n","- (Optional) Transaction rollups and beyond\n","  - [Rollups video explainer by Arthur Breitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBSs0DSuzQ)\n","  - [Nomadic Labs explanation of rollups](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/next-generation-rollups.html)\n","  - [Transaction rollups guide](https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/transaction_rollups.html)\n","\n","\n","## Direction for further research\n","- Would you be able to make any kind of a GET/POST request with your smart contract with the help of oracles? The following resource can be a good starting point to look through \n","- Transaction rollups have an extremely long finality time. What happens if a rollup is deemed invalid after many blocks and many subsequent transactions that depend on the transactions inside that rollup?\n","Direction for further research: besides bug bounties mentioned in this sprint, an even easier way to contribute to the Tezos ecosystem is to help with documentation projects. A perfect example is a website you are familiar with - OpenTezos. It is still being developed, but already has some outdated information that can be improved. They also have instructions for contributing: https://opentezos.com/contribute/opentezos. Proposing updates here can be a great way to start making a reputation for yourself in the Tezos community, which is crucial for getting better job opportunities. You can also look for other similar projects and ask if they would like similar help (and in what format). "],"metadata":{"id":"NMsQy2YqJqES"}}]}
