To do this, we will use LIGO - one of the most popular high-level languages for developing Tezos smart contracts. You will follow the Tezos Academy tutorial which has a very nice feature of allowing you to choose one of the possible syntaxes, depending on what languages you have the most experience with. Finally, you will see that deploying a smart contract is actually very easy - it can even be done in an online IDE. Similarly, interacting with a contract is just as easy with some online tools. All you will need is a wallet with an account in testnet containing some Tez (refer back to Part 2 if you still don’t have one). Note that everything can of course also be done using CLI, but we shall do that in later parts of this course.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Key Resources and tasks\n","- Read [this introduction to LIGO](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction ) up to “Runnable code snippets” *(5 minutes)*\n","\n","\n","- Go through chapters 1-13 of [LIGO Academy](https://academy.ligolang.org/), making sure to try out the practical exercises in each chapter\n","  - Choose the syntax that is the most comfortable for you (JSLigo, CameLIGO, PascaLigo). In the options menu at the top left corner, you can choose the syntax that you prefer.\n","  - Don't worry about understanding all the types linked in the Gitlab repo at the starting chapter just yet.\n","  - Even though this is framed as a game, you can easily use this site as a reference manual by going to different chapters using the navigation at top left. Another manual can be found here: https://ligolang.org/docs/language-basics/types/ \n","  - Don't expect to get the correct answers all of the time. Sometimes multiple ways to write the answer will be valid, while sometimes there might even be errors in the suggested answer. But whenever an error is shown, make sure you understand whether you actually made a mistake or not. You can actually note the errors that you spot and discuss them with a peer during a review session to confirm whether you spotted them correctly.\n","  - It can be interesting to sometimes switch between the different LIGO syntaxes to compare what they look like.\n","  - Starting from roughly chapter 6, you are strongly encouraged to do some actual running of the code that you write – e.g. testing whether a function you wrote works and what it outputs or testing the limits of the language (e.g. what happens if you don’t define a type for a variable).  To run code, we suggest using https://ide.ligolang.org/  . Simply write a new function at the end of the sample code block given, then in the top right corner under “configure” choose “Evaluate function”, write your function name under “Function name” and enter the parameters you want to give you function. \n","- After going through the first 13 chapters of Ligo Academy, use https://ide.ligolang.org/ to deploy a super simple smart contract on a testnet (it can simply store a number that you send as a parameter). If you’re really curious and don’t mind spending a couple of cents, you can even do it on the mainnet!\n","- Call your smart contract via tezos-client.\n","- Check your smart contract via [Better Call Dev](https://better-call.dev/)\n","- Call your testnet smart contract via [Better Call Dev](https://better-call.dev/)\n","- And finally, be sure to check what community channels there are for LIGO (https://ligolang.org/contact) \n","\n","## Direction for Further Research \n","While not crucial for developing smart contracts and dApps, it can still be interesting and sometimes convenient to set up your own node, sandbox or a baker. If you want to do in your own time, here are some useful resources to start from:\n","  - A very simple way to create a sandbox using docker: https://wiki.tezos.com/build/clients/run-a-sandbox. Note that this guide was written for older protocols, check https://gitlab.com/tezos/flextesa to get the most recent ones. Try deploying a smart contract to your sandbox.\n","  - https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtouse.html#node \n","  - https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/sandbox.html "],"metadata":{"id":"ZIysWan3S3Zn"}}]}
