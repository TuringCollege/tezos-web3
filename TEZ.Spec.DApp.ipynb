{"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Specialisation Module – Building a Tezos DApp\n","\n","## Module goals \n","- Use what you have learned so far and your previous experience in web development to build a DApp on Tezos\n","- Become comfortable exploring new concepts in web3 on your own\n","- Get practice using Tezos Taquito\n","- Determine which specific technologies you want to work with the most\n","- Use your knowledge of Web3 projects and technologies to come up with a project that could potentially have a real use case\n","- Create a strong portfolio item to demonstrate your ability to create useful work with Tezos\n","\n","\n","## Project Description\n","  In this specialisation module, you will use everything that you have learned so far (and more) to create a DApp that uses the Tezos blockchain. While it will need a lot of technical knowledge and skills, the focus is also on finding an interesting, potentially useful idea. \n","\n","  As you know, a DApp is an online application that incorporates blockchain technology. It will need separate frontend and backend work as well though, so you will be able to utilise the skills you had before this course as well. You can use any frameworks you wish, e.g. React, Angular, Vue, Node, Django, Symfony or anything else that you are comfortable with. However, to communicate with the Tezos blockchain, the Taquito library will need to be used. \n","  At the very least, completing this project will create a great portfolio item that you will be able to show to any potential Web3 employers. Not only that, if you see that the project is actually useful (feedback from the community can help you get a sense of this), it could even turn into a real project that you might want to deploy on the real Tezos blockchain for people to use! Also, since you will have interacted with many Turing College learners by now, you might even be lucky enough to find someone to work with on future projects. \n","\n","\n","*The approximate time you are expected to spend on this project is 40 hours.*\n","\n","## Project requirements\n","\n","This project will be one of the most open-ended ones so far. You will have a lot of freedom in the technologies you use and the direction of the ideas. There are still some mandatory requirements, however, which are necessary to get a good grade during the project review.\n","\n","Your DApp must use:\n","- One of: LIGO, Archetype, Smartpy\n","- [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/quick_start/ )\n","- Beacon\n","  - https://docs.walletbeacon.io/ \n","  - https://tezos.b9lab.com/beacon  \n","\n","Your dapp is required to use at least one of the following advanced features:\n","- FA.1.2 or FA.2 tokens\n","- Oracles\n","- Rollups\n","- Sapling\n","- Tickets\t\n","\n","Security and avoidance of flaws should be of high priority. \n","\n","This checklist contains some good pointers before submitting your project:\n","https://tezostaquito.io/docs/dapp_prelaunch \n","\n","Note: for many ideas, it is of course impossible to build a full production-grade DApp in the amount of time that’s dedicated to this project. You are therefore not expected to create an extremely complex solution. If your idea is quite elaborate and requires a lot of development, it is enough to create a minimal version that would work as a proof-of-concept only. \n","\n","## Project resources\n","You can use some of the following resources as a starting point:\n","- https://news.ecadlabs.com/how-to-build-your-first-tezos-dapp-2021-edition-b1263b4ba016 \n","- https://tezos.b9lab.com/taquito\n","- https://styts.com/your-first-tezos-dapp/  \n","- https://github.com/marigold-dev/training-dapp-1 \n","- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn24DYlCIk0 \n","- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2msTWzXPn4 \n","- https://wiki.tezosagora.org/build/dapp-development/taquito\n","- https://wiki.tezos.com/build/dapp-development/create-your-first-dapp \n","- https://betterprogramming.pub/build-your-first-dapp-on-tezos-270c568d4fe9 \n","\n","You should also know enough about what changes were made to Tezos recently to be able to critically evaluate every resource and check if they are up-to-date. Expect that many resources will have at least some parts that will not be 100% accurate anymore.\n","\n","Also, remember that you can check many of the popular existing popular DApps on https://tzkt.io/dapps \n","\n","\n","## Project Submission\n","- The smart contracts utilised by your DApp should be deployed on a testnet\n","- The submitted code should have a clear README file explaining how to run the project so that the reviewer could test it beforehand\n","- The README should also have an explanation of what the idea of the DApp is, what use case it tries to solve\n","- Keep in mind that after finishing your own project, you should still add correction slots to correct others. This is very useful as you will be able to meet more people interested in the same technologies and see interesting new ways on how to build projects. Our recommendation is to do at least 2 corrections of this project (this will also ensure that others submitting this project will have enough people who can review them).\n","\n","## Project presentation\n","\n","During the review of your project, you should first start with the non-technical introduction of your idea. Explain what the DApp does and why you think it is useful. There are multiple ways you can do this convincingly, e.g. you can do a quick market research, talk with some people in the web3 community, look for similar projects or anything else. \n","\n","Any frontend/backend code can be run locally during a project review. Show how your DApp can be used in practice by going through the most important functionalities.\n","\n","After you have fully introduced the DApp, explain what were the biggest technical challenges that you have faced and how you solved them. Go through the code that solves these problems. The majority of these challenges should be related to the smart contracts part of the DApp, since the reviewer might not be proficient in the exact frontend/backend framework that you use.\n","\n","Finally, talk about the potential flaws and security issues that you thought about and how you solved them. \n","\n","Bonus: demonstrate how you solved complex problems, either technical or not, using the help of the community.\n","\n","## Evaluation criteria\n","- Idea for the DApp is interesting and potentially useful\n","- Soft skills during the presentation: how convincing is the learner? Does the learner engage the reviewer in a friendly, professional manner?\n","- There is a clear README file that allows the reviewer to run the project locally\n","- The smart contracts used by the DApp are deployed on a testnet and enable the functionality of the DApp\n","- Code quality of the smart contract\n","- There are no obvious security flaws in the underlying smart contracts; security concerns have been taken into consideration\n","- Taquito and Beacon are used effectively\n","- At least one of the following features has been used effectively: FA.1.2 or FA.2 tokens, Oracles, Rollups, Sapling, Tickets\t\n","- Bonus: web3 community has been utilised for the creation of this project. E.g. asking for technical help, asking for feedback on ideas, etc.\n","\n","\n","## Sample questions:\n","Here are questions that the reviewer may choose to ask during the correction.\n","\n","- Are there any other similar DApps? How is yours unique?\n","- How does the Tezos blockchain enable a functionality in this DApp that would not be possible with web2?\n","- What security concerns were considered when creating this DApp? How did you ensure to avoid any security flaws?\n","- Is there anything different that you would do if you had to create this DApp all over again?\n","- If you had more time to work on this DApp, what would you focus on next?\n","- What do you think makes a DApp successful?\n","\n","A reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more questions.\n","\n","Note: The goal of the corrections is to promote a deeper understanding of learned topics by both learners. The reviewer and the reviewed learner must strive for a cooperative, friendly, and helpful interaction. Remember that both parties will rate each other after the correction on their technical and soft skills."],"metadata":{"id":"_hDnsWfaVFvf"}}]}
