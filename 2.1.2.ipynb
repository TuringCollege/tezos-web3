Not only is it exciting making your first transactions via command line, but it will also give you a much deeper understanding of wallets, addresses and keys. \n","\n","In case you search around for more information, as mentioned in the previous part, you might notice that since Tezos is rapidly evolving, documentation and guides can get outdated quickly. Thus it will be very useful from the very start to get into the habit of checking various resources to make sure that you have the full and up-to-date view of a certain aspect of the technology. Some of the goals in this part will be quite easy to achieve by simply following the guides given. Others, however, will encourage you to dig a bit deeper. We strongly recommend not skipping the more complicated steps or steps where you seem to get errors even though everything seems correct – trying to figure these problems out is usually what leads to the most useful learning experience.\n","\n","Note, for practical, development-oriented parts such as this one, detailed time estimates are not given, as it depends extremely on the background knowledge that you have. Spending as much time as needed to get comfortable with the code that you write, exploring how and why it works. This is likely to mean, however, that parts involving such practical tasks will take significantly longer than purely theoretical ones. A suggestion to manage your time better is to move to a different section if you don’t make any progress on a task for more than an hour. In these cases, a better use of your time (and also a great learning opportunity) is to reach out to someone in the community to help you with this task.\n","\n","\n","## Key Resources\n","- While going through most of the steps in this part, following this resource (specifically the part about tezos-client) will usually be helpful:\n","  - [How to use the Tezos Client?](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtouse.html#client )\n","<BR> If something doesn’t work or seems confusing in the first resource, you can check for additional information here:\n","  - [Open Tezos guide](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/cli-and-rpc) (the part about tezos-client has a lot of relevant examples)\n","  - [TQTezos client guide](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client/)\n","  - [Wiki Tezos client guide](https://wiki.tezos.com/build/clients/installation-and-setup)\n","\n","## Steps to complete\n","\n","- Install tezos-client\n","  - https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client/ has instructions for various operating systems\n","- Find a working testnet and faucet.\n","  <BR> Useful resources:\n","  - All the guides mention connecting to testnets and getting faucets. However, based on when the resources were created, some might be leading to old ones. For an up to date (at least as of 2022-09) understanding of testnets and faucets, use information from https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/test_networks.html instead.\n","  - https://teztnets.xyz/\n","  - https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/ \n","- Download a faucet file\n","- Set your client to connect to a testnet found previously. Check that you can run tezos-client commands on this testnet.\n","- Use the faucet file to gain access to an address with tez balance\n","- Confirm the balance of your address using tezos-client\n","- Remove testnet warnings from CLI\n","- Find and check the contents of your tezos-client config file\n","- Change the config file to connect to a different node\n","- Find where the public, and the private keys used by tezos-client are stored on your machine.\n","- Look for some additional useful tezos-client commands and make a list for yourself. You can use the CLI manual or https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/cli-commands.html (note that many other resources point to https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/cli-commands.html, which is for an outdated version). Here are some useful commands for a start:\n","  - tezos-client  show address <alias> -S\n","  - tezos-client config reset \n","  - tezos-client import secret key <alias>\n","  - tezos-client config show\n","  - tezos-client list known contracts\n","  - tezos-client get balance for <alias>\n","  - tezos-client remember contract\n","  - tezos-client transfer <amount> from <alias> to <alias>\n","- Generate a key pair using tezos-client\n","- Use faucet bot (https://baking-bad.org/docs/, you will need Telegram installed) to get tez to the public key created by the CLI\t\n","- Check that you received the free tez using CLI\n","- Check that Tezos bot transfer has been made to you address using a block explorer (make sure you are checking the appropriate network)\n","<BR> Useful resources:\n","  - https://tzkt.io/ \n","  - https://tezblock.io/ \n","  - https://tzstats.com/ \n","- Make a transfer between two of your accounts\n","- Check the transfer on an explorer\n","- Delegate your tez to a registered baker, then withdraw the delegation\n","<BR> Useful resources:\n","  - https://opentezos.com/baking/delegating/ \n","  - https://ghostnet.tzkt.io/ (choose your testnet and check the list of bakers)\n","\n","\n","## Direction for Further Research \n","- What is the relationship between Ghostnet and Ithacanet? \n","- How are public keys and addresses related? Why do addresses exist, instead of only using public keys?\n","- Say you created a wallet via CLI and got funds transferred to it. You now want to use a Hot Wallet like Temple instead. How would you transition to using it, instead of CLI?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZIysWan3S3Zn"}}]}
