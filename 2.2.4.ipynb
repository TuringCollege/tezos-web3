In this part, we will go into some final, more advanced concepts. Don’t be surprised if this part takes you more time to complete. If you see that it’s especially time consuming, feel free to move on to the practical project (the next part) after some time even though there are still some Koans or Academy chapters to fully understand. Go back to them later on – either when you see that they are needed for the project or if you simply have time. It’s quite common to read something that seems difficult and not understand it, leave it, then come back to it a day later and suddenly realize that everything makes sense now!\n","\n","\n","\n","## Part Tasks\n","- [Security of smart contracts](https://ligolang.org/docs/tutorials/security/ ) (60 minutes)\n","  <BR> This is an extremely important reading. Due to smart contracts usually being immutable, deploying contracts with non-obvious flaws can be extremely dangerous and costly. An additional part will focus on smart contracts in the next sprint as well.\n","- Go through Chapters 22-24, 26 of [Tezos Academy](https://academy.ligolang.org/js/chapter-lambda) \n","<BR> Chapter 25 will be easier to understand once you learn about Michelson, so we recommend not going through it just yet. \n","<BR> Make sure you understand the solution of chapter 24. Not only is this an exercise in understanding a more complicated smart contract (can you find some weird things about how it works?), but it also uses some core functional programming techniques. In case you haven’t encountered folds (or reduces) in functional programming, the following should be helpful: \n","  - https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Fold+in+functional+programming \n","  - https://ligolang.org/docs/language-basics/sets-lists-tuples#folded-operation \n","  - Koan 13 of https://github.com/ligolang/ligo-koans\n","\n","- Koans 11-14 of https://github.com/ligolang/ligo-koans\n","- [Polymorphism in LIGO](https://ligolang.org/docs/advanced/polymorphism)\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NMsQy2YqJqES"}}]}
