In this sprint, you will learn how to understand and write it. Since Michelson is a low level language that’s quite complicated to work with, people rarely work with it directly, but it’s still quite common to sometimes debug or optimise your code using it.\n","  Besides Michelson, you will go deeper into a crucial part of smart contracts and web3 in general – security and ensuring that your contracts do not have any flaws. With most web3 applications being responsible for handling large amounts of money and since it’s so difficult to make any changes to smart contracts after they have been deployed, one needs to be extremely careful to only deploy them once they are as secure as possible. Leaving even a single mistake can mean potential millions of dollars lost. Due to the importance of this topic, the practical project of this sprint will focus on security as well.\n","  Finally, you will learn about more advanced features of Tezos, such as tickets, sapling, oracles and more. Even though it’s not crucial to become proficient in each one of these right now, it is still very important to know that these features exist and that you can learn and utilise them in case you find yourself working on a project that needs them.\n","\n","\n","**Sprint Goals**\n","- Understand why it’s useful to know Michelson\n","- Learn how to write and debug Michelson\n","- Learn about more recent and advanced features of the Tezos blockchain\n","- Learn the principles that help to avoid flaws in smart contracts\n","- Learn about techniques to optimise your smart contracts\n","\n","\n","\n","## Part 1 – Michelson basics\n","Since every smart contract in Tezos is executed as Michelson code, it is inevitable that you will encounter it sooner or later. Even though most of the time you will be using higher-level languages like LIGO, SmartPy or Archetype, you might sometimes want to debug the Michelson code that gets created. Furthermore, even though not an easy task, you could look at deployed contracts and see their Michelson code and understand what they’re doing, Besides these practical uses, for many developers it can be quite an interesting experience to learn a stack-based language, since it works extremely differently than the most common object oriented or functional languages used today. \n","\n","There will be two parts in total for practising Michelson. While going through them, be sure to use the very convenient Jupyter kernel provided by Baking Bad to test your code out! As always, don’t just run the code provided, but try experimenting with it by changing something and testing out your assumptions.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Key Resources\n","- Tools useful for working with Michelson:\n","  - [A VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=baking-bad.michelson) for Michelson syntax highlighting\n","  - [Michelson Kernel](https://github.com/baking-bad/michelson-kernel). Recommended to use option 2 - Docker. \n","- Guides\n","  - [Baking Bad Michelson guide](https://michelson.baking-bad.org/introduction.html) Up to chapter 7 (inclusive)\n","  - [Open Tezos guide](https://opentezos.com/michelson/tutorial#other-basic-stack-operators-dig-dug) (Section about DIG and DUG only)\n","- Reference documents (don’t go through the right now, just use it whenever you want to look something up)\n","  - https://tezos.gitlab.io/michelson-reference/\n","  - https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/michelson.html \n","- [Community](https://www.michelson.org/). It's really recommended joining at least Slack, as the community here is active and you can get help easily\n","\n","\n","- [Open Tezos - an optional resource if you would like to try a different guide](https://opentezos.com/michelson)\n","  <BR> The linked VScode extension has not been updated for some time. The previously linked one is recommended.\n","  <BR>A sandbox is also not necessary since you know very well how to run commands on testnets now.\n","  <BR> Unfortunately, some images are not working properly. However, that should not prevent you from understanding the resource.\n","  <BR> While it’s a large tutorial, you might notice that some sections are quite easy or simply read like documentation of different types/functions that are quite obvious or easy to look up. It’s enough to go over them quickly once you start understanding the core of how Michelson works. However, it’s recommended that you try running at least some of the suggested commands using CLI, just to make sure that you’re familiar with it.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NMsQy2YqJqES"}}]}
