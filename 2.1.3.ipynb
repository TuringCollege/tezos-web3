In this part we will look in depth into how the governance process works and how the new amendments get implemented.

After understanding how it works, to get a more nuanced view, you will also read some opinion articles about cases where such a governance system might not work and what the dangers of it are.\n","\n","\n","## Key Resources\n","\n","- [An in-depth look at the governance process in Tezos](https://opentezos.com/tezos-basics/governance-on-chain) *(90 minutes)*\n","<BR> While reading about the governance periods, it’s very interesting to check https://www.tezosagora.org/period/78 and see how the periods actually played out in practice.
