Instead of just making you more experienced in LIGO, however, this practice will also make you start noticing nuances about how Tezos smart contracts work in general. For optimal learning, we suggest working on creating a schedule for yourself where you do some LIGO coding daily. The ligo-koans library is a good way to achieve this, as it provides multiple short exercises for you to work on. Leave yourself enough time to explore each exercise until you fully understand it and avoid trying to force yourself to move so fast as to forget the things you’ve learned the next day.\n","\n","Parts 1 and 3 of this sprint will be more theory focused. First, the current implementation of Tezos’ Liquid Proof of Stake algorithm will be explored. If you’re particularly curious, you can even try to find out how it differs from the previous algorithms that Tezos used. Next, some notable projects and use cases of Tezos will be introduced – of course, it’s a very broad topic and we will only aim to touch the most well-known ones to give you a starting point.\n","\n","\n","**Sprint Goals**\n","- Understand how the current LPOS algorithm of Tezos works\n","- Start practicing LIGO regularly\n","- Learn about the most common flaws in smart contracts and how to avoid them\n","- Practice using the LIGO compiler via CLI\n","- Get a more advanced understanding of LIGO and Tezos smart contracts\n","\n","\n","## Part 1 – Liquid Proof of Stake in Tezos\n","A unique and interesting part of Tezos is the Liquid Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Interestingly, the on-chain governance allowed it to be changed significantly since its original version. Many core constants have been changed, such as the time to mine the blocks and even the whole algorithm was swapped out from Emmy to TenderBake. In this part, you will look deeply into how the current consensus algorithm works. Understanding it will not only mean that you are knowledgeable of one of the core aspects of Tezos but also allow you to (if you desire) get into baking or delegating fully understanding the system.\n","\n","\n","## Key Resources\n","- [Quick intro to LPOS](https://opentezos.com/baking ) *(5 minutes)*\n","\n","- [A medium-depth explanation of how LPOS in Tezos works](https://opentezos.com/baking/baking_explained ) *(30 minutes)*\n","\n","- [How rewards are decided](https://opentezos.com/baking/reward ) *(20 minutes)*\n","\n","- [Nakamoto-style vs BFT consensus systems](https://wiki.tezosagora.org/learn/baking/proofofstake)\n",")*(5 minutes)*\n","-  [In-depth look into the current LPOS algorithm](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/consensus.html ) *(60 minutes)*\n","<BR>You should skip the “Shell-protocol interaction revisited” section\n","[Risks associated with baking](https://opentezos.com/baking/baking_risks ) *(15 minutes)*\n","\n","- To keep regularly practicing LIGO, go through koans 1-5 of https://github.com/ligolang/ligo-koans *(40 minutes)*\n","\n","\n","\n","## Direction for Further Research\n","- Are there any ideas for further improvements of the LPOS algorithm in Tezos?
